MARS COLONIZATION GUIDE: 2040 EDITION

1. ATMOSPHERE & BREATHING
The Martian atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide. It is too thin to breathe (approx 1% of Earth's pressure).
Colonists must ideally wear pressurized EVA suits outside. Inside the habitat, we use MOXIE-style oxygen generators that convert CO2 into O2.

2. WATER RESOURCES
Water is primarily harvested from subsurface ice deposits found at the poles and mid-latitudes.
Recycling is critical: The W.A.T.E.R. system (Waste Analysis and Treatment for Environmental Recovery) recovers 98% of all water from sweat, urine, and humidity.

3. FOOD PRODUCTION
The Martian soil (regolith) is toxic due to perchlorates. It must be washed and treated with bacteria before planting.
Aeroponics and hydroponics are the primary farming methods. Genetically modified potatoes, algae, and insect protein (crickets) form the staple diet.

4. RADIATION SHIELDING
Mars lacks a global magnetic field, exposing the surface to solar and cosmic radiation.
Habitats are built either underground (lava tubes) or 3D-printed using regolith concrete with a thickness of at least 2 meters. Water tanks are often stored in the roof to provide extra shielding.

5. COMMUNICATION
Communication delay with Earth ranges from 3 to 22 minutes depending on planetary alignment.
Real-time phone calls are impossible. All communication is asynchronous (email, voice messages, video logs). The "Interplanetary Internet" uses Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN).

6. DAILY LIFE
A Martian day (Sol) is 24 hours and 39 minutes.
Gravity is 38% of Earth's. Use caution when lifting heavy objects; inertia remains the same even if weight is less.
Exercise for 2 hours daily is mandatory to prevent bone density loss and muscle atrophy.
